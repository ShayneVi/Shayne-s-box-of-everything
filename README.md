# Shayne-s-box-of-everything
(DND 5e 2014 ruleset as of now. Will update it in the future. Does not work with dnd 5e 4.0 as of now either)
Welcome to my box of everything! In this module you will find all my brother and I's creations. It will range in everything, be it existing things or homebrew created be me and my brother. Everything is automated by myself. The classed and subclasses in this module were not tested thouroughly, so they may be underwhelming or overpowered.  Give me feedback through discord DMs, any kind of feedback to make things better and more balanced is appreciated.

As of version 0.1, 2 new subclass and one full class (no subclass for that one) are in this module, with a couple of other things.
The subclasses are:
Arcane Bloodline Sorcerer - A sorcerer who excells at using magic missile spell.
Star Patron Warlock - A warlock who made a pact with a star, gaining special abilities of constellations.

The new class is:
Elemental Knight - The elemental Knight Harness the power of the elements flowing through him as he attune himself to them.
